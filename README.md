## 🧠 About me
I'm a developer passionate about **games, backend systems, and creative technology**.  
I enjoy building experiences that blend **performance, design, and solid architecture** — from native C++ games to scalable backend services.

Currently focused on:
- Game development with **Unreal Engine 5** and **Unity**
- Backend architecture with **Node.js + Express**
- Data-driven systems and software design
